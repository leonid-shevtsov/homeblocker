# The upstream DNS server (required)
# For domains that are not blocked, homeserver will ask the upstream server.
# It can be your provider's DNS, or a global one.
#
# Make sure that your homeblocker can access the upstream.
# (Are you blocking all other DNS on your router? Make an exception for homeblocker's machine.)
upstream: 1.1.1.1

# "Blocks" are units of configuration for homeblocker.
#
# A block defines a list of domains to block, and a blocking schedule.
#
# You can have as many blocks as you want.
#
# When resolving a domain name, homeblocker will return an empty result,
# if any of the blocks is active and matches.
blocks:

  # The block name is arbitrary and is only here for your convenience.
  youtube:

    # These exact domains, plus their "www." subdomain, will be blocked
    domains:
      - youtube.com
      - youtube.l.google.com

    # All subdomains of these domains (of any level), but not the domain itself,
    # will be blocked
    wildcard_domains:
      - googlevideo.com
      - ytimg.com

    # Schedule is a multi-line string in crontab format
    # Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview for usage
    #
    # schedule: |
    #   * 9-17 * * * on
    #
    # Note that the schedule isn't used exactly as a crontab.
    # You do not define *moments* when the blocker comes on or off.
    # You define *intervals* when it works;
    # so if an instance of time matches the cron expression,
    # then the blocker is on or off, based on the cron command.
    #
    # How it is applied:
    # - by default the block is on all the time (if that is what you want just omit the schedule)
    # - the "command" in the crontab MUST be "on" or "off"
    # - for an interval the lower bound is inclusive, and the upper is exclusive
    # - later lines override former lines: last matching line wins
    #
    # Some examples:

    # Let the poor kid watch his youtube from 6 PM to 8 PM
    # (note that the interval is top-open: the block will come back on at 8 PM sharp)
    #
    # schedule: |
    #   * 18-20 * * * off

    # Unblock on the weekends (comma-separated values are not supported)
    #
    # schedule: |
    #   * * * * 0 off
    #   * * * * 6 off

    # Christmas day is special; finals week is too
    #
    # schedule: |
    #   * 18-20 * * * off
    #   * * 25 12 * off
    #   * * 7-14 5 * on
